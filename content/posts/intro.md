## introduction
I hate politics.
Your views are useless.
Not the royal "you".
Not some metaphorical reader of this post.
I'm talking about YOU.
YOUR VIEWS ARE USELESS. 
I don't care what they are.
I don't care who you are.
You hold useless views, and you are wasting your own time, energy, and effort holding them. [1]

Worse than you simply maintaining useless views, you are likely doing something much worse with them. 
You are probably sharing them. 
You are probably discussing them with your friends, debating them with your rivals, and arguing about them into the void on the internet. 
This is not only a waste of your time and mental energy, but the time and energy of those who have had the misfortune of interacting with you.

## Background
For all of human history, the power has been held by a small number of well connected and wealthy people. 
Chances are, you are not one of them.
Not only are you not one of them, you can't even convince them to do anything other than what they already wanted to do anyway. 
Your vote, no matter how well researched, how well reasoned, and how particularly placed, is cancelled out by a single vote from a [BAD OPINIONS] person.
Your donation, no matter how big, is completely eclipsed by the gazillions of dollars allocated by special interst groups, gazillionaires, unions, and people with trust funds.
You are powerless in [CURRENT SYSTEM].
Sharing your ideas accomplishes nothing because the people you are sharing your ideas with are in the same powerless situation as you.
The worst part about all of this is that all of the energy and effort you're putting into thinking about and worrying about politics is doing nothing in your day-to-day life, but make you less fun to be around.

In my few (27) years on this earth, I've done a small (really miniscule) amount of research, and I've found a single thing to be true in all times of political upheval. 
The rich, well-connected, and powerful always turn out okay in times of turmoil.
In a capitalist system, the rich get richer.
In a communist system, the rich get out.
In an oligarchic system, the rich become oligarchs, and then get richer.
The extremely poor generally have a bad time no matter what happens.
The middle class are usually the ones who are most at the whims of the rich and powerful.
This situaion is hopeless for many, but ALAS! I have the solution!

## Get-Moneyism
Get-Moneyism is a political philosophy centered not around central control (or lack there of) of the populace, but around control of your everyday life.
The philosophy is based around the idea that if you can become the rich, powerful, and well-connected, you'll probably be fine no matter what happens.
Beyond that, your opinion begins to matter once you're rich, powerful, and well-connected. 

Practical Get-Moneyism begins as follows:
1. Observe something going on in the world
2. Determine if your thought and action would change the situation
3. Determine if you wish to change the situation
4. If you are cool with it or you don't have the power to change it, just ignore it.
5. If you can change the situation, change it according to the benefit of you and those you wish to help. Otherwise, shut up

here are a few scenarios we can use to practice the Get-Moneyist philosophy.
### Health
1. I'm fat and out of shape
2. I can change this situation with my actions
3. I wish to change the situation
4. I will change the situation
5. I will eat better and exercise

### Tax rates
1. Taxes are higher than I would like
2. My actions cannot change the situation
3. I don't like the high tax rates
4. I will do nothing because my efforts will be better spent making more money
5. I wouldn't be able to do anything about it any way, so I'll keep my opinions to myself.

### War
1. My country is at war
2. I am not a high level general
3. I wish we weren't at war
4. I will do nothing about it because my efforts will be better spent getting in shape (because I'm going to get drafted) or making more money (so I can leave)
5. I can't really do anything about it, so I'll keep my opinions to myself.

## Late-Stage Get-Moneyism
If you get far enough in the philosophy, you'll be happy, healthy, wealthy, and well connected. 
At that point, you will now have the power to directly change the world. 
Do it according to your wishes.

## Is this satire
not really

## What about [EXCUSE]
I don't really care. If you can't make your own life better, maybe share the philosophy with someone who can help you out

## This is just promoting the bootstraps myth
Yeah bro, it's crazy how everyone I know that complains about the bootstraps myth has either never attempted to do anything with their life, or they've done something with their life and think they're so special that no one else can. NOTE: you're not that special

## But what about...
I don't give a shit. Please go away. Your opinion objectively doesn't matter, and yelling it at me (a guy who doesn't matter) will do nothing to further your interests.
