# Principles of Get-Moneyism
Get-Moneyism can be simply defined by a small set of rules

- Politics are not the most important thing in your life

You are free to hold political opinoins. You are free to vote and share your opinions.
You should, however, understand there are more things to life than just politics. 

- Your political reach is limited

There is not a lot you can do on the national level aside from being one of tens of millions of votes.
On the State level, you may be one of millions.
On the local level, you may have a much more profound effect on the world.
Your energy and emotions should be spent in proportion to your reach.

- Your personal impact on your own life is not limited

You have more control than any politician over your own life.

- Your personal impact on those around you is not limited

You have more power over others than you may expect.
The energy you put into the world will affect those around you.

- Your energy should be spent improving your life and the lives around you

Given the above points, you should use your limited time and energy on this earth helping yourself and others.

- Relationships are more important than political structures

Politics should never get in the way of personal relationships.
